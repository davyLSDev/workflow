workflow
========

Results Based Management tool coupled with a Getting Things Done timer
(the seed work comes from the beginning of this project on SourceForge)

This helps you get your short / medium / long term work projects done. It uses GTD, Pomodoro, and RBM planning techniques, along with some of my own ideas. 

I decided to program this in C# because when I transition from being an ESL teacher back into the programming and scientific work world, I will be working on projects in C#. You have to build this project yourself using MonoDevelop (I am using 2.8.8.4, because that is the latest version I can use on my mac without upgrading from OSX 10.5.8 (Leopard). 

About the versions ...

This project was turned into a Git repository where the files in the directory were added and committed as a first commit. Then, SF was added as a remote origin and the repo was pushed to SF. After that initial commit to SF, the project source was packaged up and uploaded to SF, along with this README: https://sourceforge.net/projects/rbmhelper/files/Planning%200.1/
